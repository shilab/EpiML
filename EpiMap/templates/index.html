            <h1>Epistasis Analysis Server: An open machine learning web service and model repository for
                epistasis analysis </h1>
            <!--
            <p> Epistasis analysis is a foundation in the analysis of genetic networks. The concept of epistasis was
                introduced nearly 100 years ago and today underpins our interpretation of genetic pathways. If a
                mutation in one gene masks the effects of a mutation in a second gene, then the first gene is said to be
                epistatic to the second. The aim of epistasis analysis is to identify the group of genes controlling a
                particular cellular process or pathway and to establish an order‐of‐function map that reflects the
                sequence of events in a pathway controlled by several genes. </p>
                -->
            <p> Epistasis analysis is a foundation in the analysis of genetic networks. The term “epistasis” is
                sometimes used to describe some form of statistical interaction between genetic factors and is
                alternatively sometimes used to describe instances in which the effect of a particular genetic variant
                is masked by a variant at another locus. Here, we define epistasis as the situations that the phenotype
                variance could be explained by the interactions or
                combinations of (epi-)genetic variants, instead of individual (epi-)genetic variants alone.
            </p>
            <p> This server provides pair-wise epistasis analysis. First, we identify the main effects using a model
                with only main effect on the phenotype. Second, a corrected phenotype is calculated by removing the
                significant main effect from the original phenotype. Third, we select features with epistatic effect on
                the corrected phenotype. Finally, we run the full model with main and epistatic effects on the
                previously selected main and epistatic features.</p>
            <!--
            <p> By using this server, biologists and biomedical researchers can identify a set of main and epistatic
                effects based on their own data. To help analysis results, we provide many interactive visualization,
                with options to zoom in and out for diverse views of the data and results. Besides, many external
                resources are embedded to enhance convenience.</p>
