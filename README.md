# EpiML

EpiML can detect main effect and epistatic effect features in your data by using several build-in machine learning methods and produce many interactive visualizations to help understand results. Especially for some case studies like SNP and miRNA data, external resources are embedded for epistasis analysis. 

An illustration of EpiML is shown in following:

*Figure 1. The workflow of epistasis web service. a. Our epistasis analysis server allows users describe their job, upload data and select a machine learning method for analysis. b. We provide interactive tools for visualizing and downloading results. c. Customize analysis. All automatically generated Jupyter notebooks and pre-configured Docker containers can be downloaded, modified and rerun, allowing users to fully customize their analysis code on local computers.*
